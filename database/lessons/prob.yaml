                This is the introduction. I am Stuart Allen.

    - body: >
            Definition (sample space): The sample space of an experiment is the
            set of all possible outcomes.

    - body: >
            Examples: Flipping a coin: {Heads,Tails}. Rolling a 6-sided die:
            {1,2,3,4,5,6}. Both together: {Heads,Tails} × {1,2,3,4,5,6}.

    - body: >
            Definition (event): An event is a subset of a sample space.

    - body: >
            Examples: When rolling a 6-sided die, the event that the result is
            even: {2, 4, 6}

    - body: >
            Definition (probability): Given an experiment with a sample space S
            of equally likely outcomes and an event E (being a subset of these
            outcomes,i.e. E ⊆ S), the probability of E occurring is:

    - body: >
            Example: If we roll a 6-sided die once, what is the probability of
            rolling an even number?
    - body: >
            Solution: The sample space S is all the possible outcomes, so
            S={1,2,3,4,5,6}. The event E that the result is an even number is {2,4,6}.
            Therefore P(E) = |E| / |S| = 3 ÷ 6 = 0.5

            Another example: If we roll a pair of 6-sided dice once, what is the
            probability that the total is 6?

    - body: >
            Solution: This is the sample space for the experiment:

    - body: >
            We can see that there are 36 possible outcomes, so |S| = 36. Now we
            need to consider the event where the total is 6. This is:

    - body: >
            and so |E| = 5. Therefore the probability is P(E) = 5 ÷ 36 ≈ 0.1389

            Definition (sum rule): Let A and B be two events. Then the probability
            that A OR B happens is given by:

            Example: A single card is drawn from a pack of 52. What is the probability
            that the card is an Ace or a Heart?

    - body: >
            Solution: There are 4 aces and 13 hearts in a pack of cards, so
            P(Ace) = 4 ÷ 52 and P(Heart) = 13 ÷ 52. There is only 1 card that is
            both an Ace and a Heart, so P(Ace and Heart) = 1 ÷ 52. Therefore by the sum rule:
            P(Ace or Heart) = P(Ace) + P(Heart) - P(Ace and heart) = 16 ÷ 52 ≈ 0.3077

    - body: >
            Definition (conditional probability): Given two events A and B, the
            conditional probability P(A|B) (or the probability of A given that B
            happens) is given by:

    - body: >
            Definition (product rule): Given two events A and B, the probability
            that both A and B occur is given by:
