  introduction: >
                This is a brief introduction to counting. This lesson covers permutations
                and combinations and has worked solutions for some typical exam questions

            Definition (permutation): A permutation of a set is an order of the
            objects in sequence
    - body: >
            Example: S = {1, 2, 3}. The permutations of S are:
            (1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 2), (2, 1, 3), (2, 3, 1), (3, 1, 2), (3, 2, 1).

            A set of n objects has n! (n factorial) permutations. We can use
            permutations in Python with the itertools module

            Definition (r-permutation): An r-permutation of a set of n elements
            is an ordered selection of elements taken from the set without repetition.

    - body: >
            The number of r-permutations of a set of n elements is given by:

            Example: Suppose we have a squad of 14 cricketeers. How many batting
            line-ups of 11 players are there?

    - body: >
            Solution: P(14,11) = 14!/3! = 14529715200

    - body: >
            Definition (r-combination): An r-combination of a set of size n is a
            subset of size r (note that the order does not matter)

    - body: >
           The number of r-combinations of a set of n elements is given by:

    - body: >
            Example: How many different ways are there of choosing a team of 5
            basketball players from a squad of 12?

    - body: >
            Solution: We don't care about order here, so the answer is C(12, 5)
            = 12!/(5! Ã— 7!) = 792
